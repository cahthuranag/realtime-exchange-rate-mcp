> Give your AI coding assistant a live window into the foreign-exchange market.

A Model Context Protocol server that lets **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Claude Desktop**, **Windsurf**, and any other MCP-compatible client fetch real-time currency rates, historical data, and multi-currency lookups.

After installation, your assistant can answer questions like:

- *"What's the current USD to EUR rate?"*
- *"Show me how GBP/JPY moved over the last 30 days."*
- *"Convert 250 USD into CAD at a real rate."*
- *"Compare USD against EUR, GBP, and JPY simultaneously."*
- *"List every supported currency."*

## What you get

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Currencies** | 150+ ISO 4217 codes, all major and most exotics |
| **Update frequency** | Mid-market rates refresh every ~60 seconds |
| **Historical depth** | Up to 1 year via `1d` / `7d` / `30d` / `1y` granularity |
| **Tools exposed** | 4 — `get_exchange_rate`, `get_historical_rates`, `get_rates_authenticated`, `list_currencies` |
| **Transport** | stdio (subprocess), MCP 1.x compatible |
| **Runtime** | Node.js ≥18 |

---

## Get an API key (required)

The server **will not start** without a valid `ALLRATES_API_KEY`. Rates are served by [AllRatesToday](https://allratestoday.com); a free key is enough for development and personal use.

1. Register at [allratestoday.com/register](https://allratestoday.com/register)
2. Verify your email
3. Copy your key from the dashboard (format: `art_live_xxxxx`)
4. Use it as `ALLRATES_API_KEY` in the configs below

If the key is missing, the server prints clear registration instructions on stderr and exits with code 1.

---

## Install

The server is published as an npm package. The simplest install is **zero-install via `npx`**, which is what every config below uses.

```bash
# Run without installing (recommended)
npx -y @allratestoday/mcp-server

# Or install globally
npm install -g @allratestoday/mcp-server
allratestoday-mcp
```

Both commands launch the stdio MCP server and wait for a client to connect. They're not meant to be run directly from your shell — your MCP client launches them as a subprocess.

---

## Quick setup per client

Each client reads MCP servers from a different config file. Pick yours below.

### Claude Code

The fastest path uses the built-in CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add allratestoday -- npx -y @allratestoday/mcp-server
claude mcp env allratestoday ALLRATES_API_KEY=art_live_xxxxx
```

Restart Claude Code. Verify by asking it: *"What's the current USD to EUR rate?"*

### Cursor

Edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (or `.cursor/mcp.json` inside your project for project-scoped servers):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "allratestoday": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@allratestoday/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ALLRATES_API_KEY": "art_live_xxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Cursor. The four tools should appear in the MCP tool picker.

### Claude Desktop

Edit the config file (path depends on OS):

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "allratestoday": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@allratestoday/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ALLRATES_API_KEY": "art_live_xxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Fully quit and reopen Claude Desktop** (Cmd+Q on macOS, right-click tray icon → Exit on Windows). Closing the window alone keeps the old config loaded.

### Windsurf

Edit `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "allratestoday": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@allratestoday/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ALLRATES_API_KEY": "art_live_xxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Windsurf.

### Generic stdio MCP client

Any MCP host that supports stdio transport works. The launch command is:

```
npx -y @allratestoday/mcp-server
```

…with the environment variable `ALLRATES_API_KEY` set. The protocol version is MCP 1.x.

---

## Verify it works

After configuring your client, test in this order:

1. **Server starts** — open the client. If the MCP integration shows a red dot or "failed to connect", the API key is missing or wrong (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).

2. **Tools are listed** — most clients have a "tools" or "MCP" panel. You should see:
   - `get_exchange_rate`
   - `get_historical_rates`
   - `get_rates_authenticated`
   - `list_currencies`

3. **A live call returns a number** — ask the assistant:

   > *What's the current USD to EUR rate?*

   The assistant will call `get_exchange_rate(source: "USD", target: "EUR")` and reply with a real rate (e.g. `"USD to EUR is currently 0.9214."`). If it fabricates a number without making a tool call, the server isn't connected.

---

## Tools reference

All four tools require an API key.

### `get_exchange_rate`

Current mid-market rate between two currencies.

**Input**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ALLRATES_API_KEY` | — | **yes** | Your API key. The server exits at startup if unset. |
| `ALLRATES_BASE_URL` | `https://allratestoday.com/api` | no | Override for self-hosted or staging deployments. |

You set these in your MCP client's config (in the `env` block) — not in your shell — because MCP servers are launched as subprocesses with isolated environments.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Client shows "MCP server failed to start" or red dot | `ALLRATES_API_KEY` not set or invalid | Verify the key in your client config; check it matches the dashboard |
| Tools show but every call returns "Invalid API key" | Key is malformed (missing prefix, truncated, or revoked) | Copy a fresh key from the dashboard |
| Tools return "API quota exceeded" | Plan request limit hit | Wait until next month or upgrade plan |
| Historical tool returns "Bad request" | Invalid period or unknown currency code | Period must be `1d`/`7d`/`30d`/`1y`; codes must be 3 letters |
| Server starts but tools never appear in client | Client didn't reload after config change | Fully quit (not just close) and reopen the client |
| `npx` runs but hangs forever | The server is waiting for an MCP client to connect — this is normal when run from a shell | Don't run from a shell; let your MCP client launch it |

### Inspect server logs

To see what the server is doing, run it manually with the API key set:

```bash
ALLRATES_API_KEY=art_live_xxxxx npx -y @allratestoday/mcp-server
```

You should see no output when healthy (stdio is reserved for the MCP protocol). Any errors print to stderr.

---

## Error reference

The server maps API errors to clear, actionable messages.

| HTTP status | Meaning | Tool error message |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | Success | (rate returned) |
| 400 | Bad request — usually unknown currency code | `Bad request — possibly an unknown currency code` |
| 401 | Invalid or missing API key | `Invalid API key` |
| 429 | Quota exceeded | `API quota exceeded` |
| 5xx | Upstream server-side issue | `HTTP 5xx — <upstream message>` |

The LLM will surface these messages in its response, so a user prompt that hits a 429 results in the assistant saying *"the API quota has been exceeded — please try again next month or upgrade your plan."*

---

## FAQ

**Do you store my conversation or query data?**
No. Only your API key and the request parameters (source, target, period, time) are sent to the upstream API — never the LLM's conversation context, sheet contents, or anything else.

**What happens to my API key?**
It's only sent as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header on requests to the upstream API. It's never logged or transmitted elsewhere.

**Why is my historical request slow on first call?**
Cold-start of `npx` (first run downloads the package) plus an initial upstream cache miss. Subsequent calls are fast (<200ms typically).

**Can I run this without npm/Node?**
Not currently — Node ≥18 is required. We've considered a standalone binary; if that matters to you, open an issue.

**Is there a self-hosted option?**
Yes, set `ALLRATES_BASE_URL` to point to your own instance.

**Does this work with ChatGPT?**
The Anthropic MCP standard works with any MCP-compatible client. ChatGPT Desktop has experimental MCP support; check OpenAI's docs for current status.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cahthuranag/realtime-exchange-rate-mcp.git
cd realtime-exchange-rate-mcp
npm install
npm run build
ALLRATES_API_KEY=art_live_xxxxx node dist/index.js
```

The server runs on stdio and waits for an MCP client to connect. Hit Ctrl+C to exit.

To watch and rebuild on changes during development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To test against a local instance:

```bash
ALLRATES_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api ALLRATES_API_KEY=test_key node dist/index.js
```
